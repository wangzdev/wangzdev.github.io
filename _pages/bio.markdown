I was born in rural area ,the eastern part of China,and I am a very accidentical Engineer ,due to <br><br>
a randome chance, I found the free online stanford course ,cs106A ,Programming Methodology,taught by the one <br><br>
and only professor, Mehran Sahami,from that on ,I learnt the other Stanford undergraduate  computer scicence courses <br><br>
and some graudate courses,and launched a carrer in software engineering<br><br>
I am grateful for what has happened and feel lucky to do what I am loving<br><br>
