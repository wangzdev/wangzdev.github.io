Part of the reason that I want to start this personal site is that I want to share some thoughts<br><br>
in what I am doing now ,and another reason is that I want to improve my writing skills ,haha ,yes,<br><br>
writing skills,as in these days, I find writing matters ,expressing somethings in a clear and concise way is <br><br>
is critical ,especially in the STEM field, and after these years of learning English , sadly , I findt it is <br><br>
still struggling to write something seriously,so I am motivated to do this now.<br><br>
